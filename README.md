## Script
When there are multiple lines of code to be executed, they can be run as a script. A python script is file with extension .py in which the commands which needs to executed can be stored. These files can be run from the shell or using a IDEs like VS code, spyder (MATLAB like ) etc.

## Printing and inputs
The following prints Hello in the python shell. The argument is the variable which needs to be displayed in the python terminal/shell.

`print("Hello")`

## Computer description
Input devices are keyboard, mouse and any hardware through which we send messages to the computer. The send message is read by the CPU which keeps asking for the next instruction. The RAM ot main memory keeps a copy of the variables while the instructions are executed by the CPU. The results of the execution can be viewed on the monitor
